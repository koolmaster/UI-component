<Meta title="Overview/2. Contributing" />

There are different ways you can contribute, all of which are valuable. Here's a few guidelines that should help you as you prepare your contribution.

## 1. Setup the Project

The following steps will get you up and running to contribute to Common UI:

1. Clone the repo (click the <kbd>Clone</kbd> button at the top right of
   [this page](https://github.com/koolmaster/UI-component))

2. Run locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/koolmaster/UI-component.git
cd UI-component
```

3. Setup all the dependencies and packages by running `yarn`. This
   command will install dependencies and bootstrap the repo

> If you run into any issues during this step, kindly reach out to the email koolmaster1408@gmail.com

## Development

To improve our development process, we've set up tooling and systems. Common UI
uses a monorepo structure and we treat each component has an independent package
that can be consumed in isolation.

### Tooling

- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for rapid UI component development and
  testing
- [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) for testing components and
  hooks
- [Jest](https://jest.js.org/) for a blazing fast Testing framework

### Commands

**`yarn storybook`**: run the storybook server for development and writing documents

**`yarn build`**: build a new version

**`yarn test`**: run test for all components.

**`yarn release`**: publish changed packages.

### Documentation

The documentation site is built with Storybook. If you'd like to contribute to the
docs, simply run `yarn storybook`, and build the docs with `yarn build-storybook`

## Think you found a bug?

Please conform to the issue template and provide a clear path to reproduction
with a code example. The best way to show a bug is by sending a CodeSandbox
link.

## Proposing new or changed API?

Please provide thoughtful comments and some sample API code. Proposals that
don't line up with our roadmap or don't have a thoughtful explanation will be
closed.

## Making a Pull Request?

Pull requests need only the :+1: of two or more collaborators to be merged; when
the PR author is a collaborator, that counts as one.

### Commit Convention

Before you create a Pull Request, please check whether your commits comply with
the commit conventions used in this repository.

When you create a commit we kindly ask you to follow the convention
`category(scope or module): message` in your commit message while using one of
the following categories:

- `feat / feature`: all changes that introduce completely new code or new
  features
- `fix`: changes that fix a bug (ideally you will additionally reference an
  issue if present)
- `refactor`: any code related change that is not a fix nor a feature
- `docs`: changing existing or creating new documentation (i.e. README, docs for
  usage of a lib or cli usage)
- `build`: all changes regarding the build of the software, changes to
  dependencies or the addition of new dependencies
- `test`: all changes regarding tests (adding new tests or changing existing
  ones)
- `ci`: all changes regarding the configuration of continuous integration (i.e.
  github actions, ci system)
- `chore`: all changes to the repository that do not fit into any of the above
  categories

If you are interested in the detailed specification you can visit
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ or check out the
[Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

### Steps to PR

1. Clone animation-common-ui repository

2. Create a new branch out of the `master` branch. We follow the convention
   `[type/scope]`. For example `fix/accordion-hook` or `docs/menu-typo`. `type`
   can be either `docs`, `fix`, `feat`, `build`, or any other conventional
   commit type. `scope` is just a short id that describes the scope of work

3. Make and commit your changes

4. Run `yarn test` to test verify unit tests before push

5. Push to origin and create a new PR

6. Wait for reviewing and merging to `master`

### Tests

All commits that fix bugs or add features need a test.
